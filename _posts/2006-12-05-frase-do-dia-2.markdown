_**"**__**There are just two kinds of languages: the ones everybody complains about and the ones nobody uses."**_ 

Por Bjarne Stroustrup, criador da linguagem C++, em [entrevista à revista online TechReview do MIT](http://www.techreview.com/InfoTech/17831/).

Gosto bastante também da seguinte crítica ao processo de desenvolvimento de softwares hoje em dia:

_"I think the real problem is that 'we' (that is, we software developers) are in a permanent state of emergency, grasping at straws to get our work done. We perform many minor miracles through trial and error, excessive use of brute force, and lots and lots of testing, but--so often--it's not enough._

_Software developers have become adept at the difficult art of building reasonably reliable systems out of unreliable parts. The snag is that often we do not know exactly how we did it: a system just 'sort of evolved' into something minimally acceptable..."_
